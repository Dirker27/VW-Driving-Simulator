Vehicle Prediction/Correction
=============================

EVENTUALLY: Real Vehicle => Simulink? (on-board computing, D-space)

Code (Simulink):
- Trajectory interpretation
- Intervention Strategy

NOW: CarSim
	non-linear vehicle model

MISSING: 
	- Driver Input (Throttle, steering, brake)
	- Virtual Reality Environment (track, cars, world) - MATLAB


Input: NEEDS TO BE REALISTIC
	- Logitech Racing Peripherals?


Ideal world: make driver want go FAST
	- Race?
	- Time Trial?
	- DMV course?


10/15: Ideal deadline
10/24: Prototype Presentation
^^^^ Proof o' concept

Gran-Turismo-ish?

capture vid w/ CarSim?


Table o' turns:
x, y, z, muf, theta

Volcano? Volcano.

Assumes knowledge of track within X meters



SIMULINK + CARSIM SHIT 
====================== (DaFuk?)

CarSim:
	CANNOT Maintain Real-Time updating, SLOW

SimuLink: Input to Car
	Predicts shit.




Idea:
	CarSim runs async. and updates a data file. Use data file to update things in VR,
	Reload CarSim once data written.
