BIGGEST PROBLEM: Real-time CarSim
- CarSim likes to pre-determine/run simulation
- NOT INTERACTIVE INPUT (Massive Problem!)

So... we're cutting out CarSim, 'cuz fuck that.

Looks like the logic model will be SimuLink

SimuLink
========
- Circuit-like view makes things easy for non-programmers, not so much for real ones
- CAN drop in C++ code (probs doing that)


MatLab
======
- Can do in-house VR
- Really should pipe out to Unity
